# IAM Policies, But Make It Human

This interactive explainer turns policy JSON into plain English:
“Jane can do X; Captain cannot do Y.” Quick answers, zero fluff.

<IAMPolicyExplainer client:only="react" />

## What This Shows

- Edit the policy JSON and instantly see who can do what.
- Explicit Deny beats Allow, just like the real world.
- Wildcards work: `spaces:*`, `db:prod-*`, etc.
- Optional `Principal` scoping to target users or roles.

## Why This Style?

Most policy questions boil down to one thing: “Can they do it?”
This component answers that fast—then gets out of your way.
